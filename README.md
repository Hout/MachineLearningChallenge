# MachineLearningChallenge

Solution for the challenge.

| Source file | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Get_data.ipynb | Get the data from Kaggle and unpack |
| Data_engineering.ipynb | Explore data, convert to binary category indication |
| Model.ipynb | Evaluate model & parameters |
| Classification.ipynb | Fit training data in Random Forest classifier and predict submission data |

To obtain the result, run Get_data, Data_engineering and Classification notebooks.
The Model notebook is not necessary to get the results, that was for model selection only that is programmed into Data_engineering.

Output is written to y_test.csv
